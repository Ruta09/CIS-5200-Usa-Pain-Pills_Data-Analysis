# Pain Pills Data Analysis using Hive
### Problem Statement 
The Pain Pill database, managed by the DEA, tracks extensive information on the distribution of oxycodone and hydrocodone from 2006 to 2014. The database shows that these painkillers account for three-quarters of all opioid shipments to pharmacies. The challenge is to perform a detailed county-level analysis to quantify the distribution of these drugs and to identify the companies and distributors responsible for the majority of these transactions. Such analysis is essential to address the public health impact of opioid distribution across different regions.
